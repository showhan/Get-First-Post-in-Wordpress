# To Grab Wordpress First Post

It's done on wordpress post loop where you can grab the first post and then can implement that as your requirements.

It has done by PHP increment process as like $i = 0 and then have used on loop that $i++ as post class.So by this, grab the value of i++ that means each post will have a serial class number as like 0,1,2 etc. And you can get the first post by adding condition that if($i == 0), because 0 is the intial index of that increment process. So it's getting the first post which post number is 0.

Thanks
